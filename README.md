# Bobail
Pygame project

Description:

Wandering in the streets of Athens I found an obscure shop full of strange board games. I took home with me a game called Bobail. Here is what I know about it:
Bobail originates from Madagascar. It is played by two players. Each player has 5 pieces, and in the center of the board there is a white piece called bobail. Each player's turn consists of the following steps:
1. First the player has to move the bobail piece one step, in any direction.
2. Then the player has to move with one of its five pieces in any direction, to the furthest place possible without jumping over another piece.

The goal is to move the bobail piece to the player's baseline (the row on which initially the players have their pieces). 
So if the bobail piece in the first line of a player, that player wins!
The game is also won if a player manages to completely encircle the bobail piece, so that the opponent's next move (with the bobail) is impossible.
One last thing, for its first turn, the first player doesn't play the bobail. He plays directly one of his tokens.

Simple rules, right? In play it gets quite interesting.

(This is my first try at making a program with pygame, so any constructive criticism is welcome.
I also tried to make an AI opponent to play with. Unfortunately I ran into some problems, which I couldn't solve and I eventually gave up.
I decided to leave the pieces of code in there, if you want to see it go (and crash) just uncomment some things in the main. 
If you have a solution/explanation for the problem, I would be happy to hear about it.
In making this project I was following the teachings of the wonderful Tech-with-Tim.)
